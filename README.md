## PyAutoGUI 

PyAutoGUI can take screenshots, save them to files, and locate images within the screen. This is useful if you have a small image of, say, a button that needs to be clicked and want to locate it on the screen. These features are provided by the PyScreeze module, which is installed with PyAutoGUI.

Screenshot functionality requires the Pillow module. OS X uses the screencapture command, which comes with the operating system. Linux uses the scrot command, which can be installed by running sudo apt-get install scrot.
